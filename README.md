Max materials for the intro workshop at HECK

## Description
The original format for this workshop was a three-hour, informal session. Max and I both plan to show some of our own work, along with some interesting patchers. There will also be an introductory, group exercise, followed by a semi-optional lab assignment that we can all try together.
